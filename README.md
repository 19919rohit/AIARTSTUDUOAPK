**Android Smart WebView** is a modern, open-source solution for building advanced hybrid Android apps. It allows you to effortlessly extend your app with plugins, native features, and a customizable UI.

**[DOCUMENTATION](https://docs.mgks.dev/smart-webview/)** | **[GET PREMIUM PLUGINS](https://github.com/sponsors/mgks/sponsorships?sponsor=mgks&tier_id=468838)** | **[ISSUES](https://github.com/mgks/Android-SmartWebView/issues)**


## Core Features

*   **Plugin Architecture:** Extend app functionality with self-registering plugins. See `PluginInterface.java`, `PluginManager.java`, and existing plugins in `/plugins/` for details.
*   **File Uploads & Camera Access:** Support for file selection and direct camera capture in WebView.
*   **Push Notifications:** Integrated Firebase Cloud Messaging (requires `google-services.json`).
*   **Google Analytics:** Built-in support (configure GTAG ID in `swv.properties`).
*   **Custom UI Modes:** Fullscreen and drawer layouts (configurable in `swv.properties`).
*   **Location & Permissions:** Access device GPS/location and manage permissions.
*   **Content Sharing:** Receive and handle shared content from other apps via `ShareActivity.java`.
*   **Downloads & Printing:** Handle file downloads and print web content.
*   **Modern WebView:** Secure, up-to-date, and highly configurable via `swv.properties` and `MainActivity.java`.

## Plugins

Smart WebView features a plugin system to add new features with minimal effort.

*   **Understanding Plugins:**
    *   The core contract is defined in `PluginInterface.java`.
    *   Plugin lifecycle and registration are managed by `PluginManager.java`.
    *   Example plugins (`ToastPlugin.java`, `LocationPlugin.java`) are located in `/plugins/`. These serve as excellent references for creating new plugins.

*   **Configuring & Testing Plugins:**
    *   `Playground.java` is used to configure, test, and demonstrate plugin functionality during development. This is where you set plugin-specific options like AdMob IDs or enable Biometric Auth on launch.

*  **Premium Plugins ‚≠ê:** List of premium plugins for **[Project Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/mgks)**.
    - ‚úÖ **AdMob**: Integrate Google AdMob into your app; Includes Banner, Interstitial and Rewarded ad units.
    - ‚úÖ **Biometric Auth**: Enable fingerprint or face authentication for overall app or trigger on demand with JavaScript.
    - ‚úÖ **QR & Barcode Reader**: Scan QR codes and barcodes directly from your app.
    - ‚úÖ **Image Compression**: Compress images before uploading for better performance.
    - ‚úÖ **JS Interface**: Allows JavaScript code to call native methods and receive callbacks.
    - üöß **Google Auth**: Add Google authentication for seamless sign-in.
    - üöß **Payment Gateway**: Integrate payment solutions for in-app purchases.
    - üöß **Enhanced Video Player**: Handle requests for fullscreen video playback (e.g., from YouTube or Vimeo embeds).
    - üöß **CSS Injection**: Dynamically inject custom CSS into your web pages.
    - üöß **WebRTC**: Build rich, real-time communication features directly into your web app.
    - üöß **Local Network Access**: Host app with local network (e.g., for a dev server or an enterprise intranet).

   *<sup>üöß</sup> Currently in development; availability in final bundle is subject to change.*

## Quick Start

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mgks/Android-SmartWebView.git
    ```
2.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    *   `File > Open > Select the project folder`
3.  **Configure `swv.properties`:**
    *   Open `app/src/main/assets/swv.properties`.
    *   Change `app.url` to your website's URL and adjust other settings as needed. This is the main configuration file for the app.
4.  **Add `google-services.json` (Optional):**
    *   If you plan to use Firebase services (like FCM for push notifications), obtain your `google-services.json` file from the Firebase console and place it in the `app/` directory.
5.  **Build & Run:**
    *   `Build > Clean Project` then `Build > Rebuild Project`

## Basic Configuration

All primary configuration is done within `app/src/main/assets/swv.properties`:

*   **Main Application URL:**
    *   Set `app.url` to your web application's address.
    *   `offline.url` (`file:///android_asset/web/offline.html`) is used if no internet is detected.
*   **Feature Toggles:**
    *   Enable or disable features (file uploads, camera access, location services, pull-to-refresh, etc.) by modifying the `feature.*` boolean properties.
*   **Permissions:**
    *   Review and adjust permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml` based on the features you enable. For example, `CAMERA` for camera uploads, `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` for GPS.
*   **Plugin Configuration:**
    *   Plugin behavior (like AdMob IDs or Biometric Auth on launch) is configured in `Playground.java`. This allows you to change settings without modifying the plugin source code itself.

## Further Information & Understanding the Code

The best way to understand the project in depth is to explore the source code:
*   **`app/src/main/assets/swv.properties`**: Contains all global configurations.
*   **`SWVContext.java`**: The central class that loads the configuration and holds app state.
*   **`MainActivity.java`**: The main entry point, handles WebView setup, and integrates core features.
*   **`Functions.java`**: Utility functions used throughout the app.
*   **`PluginInterface.java`, `PluginManager.java`**: Key components of the plugin architecture.
*   **`Playground.java`**: The central place for configuring and testing plugins.
*   The `plugins/` directory: Contains example and premium plugin implementations.
*   Inline comments throughout the code provide additional context.
